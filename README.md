# Emacs Config File

My standard emacs config file (as backup, and to have it available everywhere).

The single source of truth is the [config.org](./config.org) file, from which the *init.el* file
can be generated.

For documentation on how to do that, as well as on the file contents, have a look at the
*config.org* file.

The *init.el* file is checked in simply so that a working config is available directly, without
having to tangle a usable config from the org document first.
